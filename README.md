# Speaker and venue based on city and budget
I created a user-friendly tool for the Regional Director of a Pharmaceutical company to help her choose which speaker she should hire and which venue to book, based on city and budget constraints. She has a roster of several potential speakers across her territory, all of whom bill at varying hourly rates, some of whom can go to multiple cities. 

I coded the underlying database in MySQL and created the user-friendly interface with Power BI. There are two drop-downs to select city and budget level; the report will spit out which speakes(s) and venue(s), if any, fit that criteria. She is building up her roster of speakers and venues to use, so some combinations give blanks. 

With her blessing, I've recreated the interface with dummy data replacing proprietary/private information.
